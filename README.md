Are the target ranges reachable?

These script is made with the assumption that you are on a debian based linux distro.

Steps for use:

git clone [this]

cd into directory

chmod 755 setup.sh

./setup.sh

Create a line seperated list of target IP Ranges IE:
ip.x.x.x/24
ip.x.x.x/31
ip.x.x.x/23

Then:
./fast-portsweep.py [target.list]
